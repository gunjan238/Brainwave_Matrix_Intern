## Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains two data analysis projects focused on deriving insights from distinct datasets: sales data and social media sentiment data. Each project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, with step-by-step explanations from data preprocessing to the final analysis and visualizations.

## Projects Overview
### 1. Sales Data Analysis
- File: Task1_Sales_Data_Analysis.ipynb
- Objective: Analyze sales data to identify trends, seasonal variations, top-performing products, and revenue patterns.
#### Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand sales by product, region, and time.
- Visualizations to display trends and insights, aiding business decision-making.
### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- File: Task2_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
- Objective: Analyze social media data to classify public sentiment and understand emotional trends in the data.
#### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing for sentiment analysis, including text cleaning and tokenization.
- Sentiment classification using machine learning or natural language processing techniques.
- Visualizations to display sentiment distributions and insights into public opinion.

#### Installation Requirements
Both projects require Python 3.7+ and the following packages:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

Additional requirements for `Sentiment Analysis`:

* `scikit-learn`
* `nltk`


Install all required packages using:

```bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
```

Usage
